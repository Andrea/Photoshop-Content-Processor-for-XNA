Photoshop-Content-Processor-for-XNA
===================================

Photoshop Content Processor for XNA. Pretty much exactly as it was found here http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2009/05/21/photoshop-texture-importer-redux.aspx but it builds to XNA 4.0
Did some clean up on the code too.
